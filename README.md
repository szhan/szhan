## Hi there 👋

I'm an NDPH Intermediate Fellow at the University of Oxford studying the evolutionary, ecological, and epidemiological dynamics of pathogens. I use a variety of approaches, methods, and tools from genomics, population genetics, phylogenetics, and community ecology. I develop novel computational methodologies and apply them to large-scale publicly available genomic datasets and novel datasets collected through collaborations.
