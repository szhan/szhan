## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm an NDPH Intermediate Fellow at the University of Oxford. I study the evolutionary, ecological, and epidemiological dynamics of pathogens using a variety of approaches, methods, and tools from genomics, population genetics, phylogenetics, and community ecology. My work involves developing novel computational methodologies and applying them to large-scale genomic datasets which are publicly available or generated through collaborations.
